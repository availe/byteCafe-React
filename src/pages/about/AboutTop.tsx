        Ever since our founder Casey David created byteCafe in 1891, our mission
        has been to provide high quality organic coffee. Sourced straight from
        locally-owned sustainable farms across South America, our famous coffees
        provide a taste unmatched across the Northeast. We continuously seek to
        improve our selection of foods and drinks while keeping true to our
        quality standards.
